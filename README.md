## Introduction

## What is the cloud?
The [cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-the-cloud) is not a physical entity, but instead is a vast network of remote servers around the globe which are hooked together and meant to operate as a single ecosystem.

## What are Cloud Servers?
A cloud [server](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/cloud-server) is powerful physical or virtual infrastructure that performs application- and information-processing storage. Cloud servers are created using virtualization software to divide a physical (bare metal) server into multiple virtual servers.

- These servers are designed to either store and manage data, run applications, or deliver content or a service such as streaming videos, web mail, office productivity software, or social media. Instead of accessing files and data from a local or personal computer, you are accessing them online from any Internet-capable device—the information will be available anywhere you go and anytime you need it.



## Key features of Cloud Servers
- Computing infrastructure that can be physical (bare metal), virtual, or a mix of the two depending on use case
- Has all the capabilities of an on-premises server
- Enables users to process intensive workloads and store large volumes of information
- Automated services are accessed on demand through an API
- Gives users the choice of monthly or as-you-go payment
- Users can opt for a shared hosting plan that scales depending on needs
