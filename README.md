## Introduction

## What is the cloud?
The [cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-the-cloud) is not a physical entity, but instead is a vast network of remote servers around the globe which are hooked together and meant to operate as a single ecosystem.

## What are Cloud Servers?
A cloud [server](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/cloud-server) is powerful physical or virtual infrastructure that performs application- and information-processing storage. Cloud servers are created using virtualization software to divide a physical (bare metal) server into multiple virtual servers.

- These servers are designed to either store and manage data, run applications, or deliver content or a service such as streaming videos, web mail, office productivity software, or social media. Instead of accessing files and data from a local or personal computer, you are accessing them online from any Internet-capable device—the information will be available anywhere you go and anytime you need it.



## Key features of Cloud Servers
- Computing infrastructure that can be physical (bare metal), virtual, or a mix of the two depending on use case
- Has all the capabilities of an on-premises server
- Enables users to process intensive workloads and store large volumes of information
- Automated services are accessed on demand through an API
- Gives users the choice of monthly or as-you-go payment
- Users can opt for a shared hosting plan that scales depending on needs

## Why Cloud Servers?
- Cost effectiveness
> With cloud servers, organizations only pay for what they need and reduce the expense that comes with maintaining server hardware.

- Scalability
> Users can scale computing and storage resources to meet changing needs. This is particularly helpful for organizations with fluctuating needs.


- Integration
> An organization’s cloud servers are networked to ensure uninterrupted communication and fast deployment. A “single pane” enables complete control.

## Considerations

- Virtual servers vs. physical servers:
>  Physical (bare metal) servers are best for data-intensive workloads. Virtual servers are better for highly variable workloads.

- Virtualization:
> Cloud servers can be physical or virtual. Virtualization software options include VMware, Parallels, and Hyper-V.

- Customization:
>  Physical servers have numerous customization options, such as more processing power, additional RAM, and backup power.

- Security:
> Security options for cloud servers include firewalls, anti-virus software, monitoring, and host intrusion protection
