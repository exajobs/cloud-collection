## What is the cloud?
The [cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-the-cloud) is not a physical entity, but instead is a vast network of remote servers around the globe which are hooked together and meant to operate as a single ecosystem.

These servers are designed to either store and manage data, run applications, or deliver content or a service such as streaming videos, web mail, office productivity software, or social media. Instead of accessing files and data from a local or personal computer, you are accessing them online from any Internet-capable deviceâ€”the information will be available anywhere you go and anytime you need it.
