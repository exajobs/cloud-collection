As Microsoft&reg; prepares for EOL on Windows Server&reg; 2008 and 2008 R2, Sophos&reg; has quit
supporting these versions of Windows Server.

### Symptoms

The following symptom applies to Server 2008 Release to Manufacturing (RTM): Sophos running on a
Windows Server 2008 fails to function properly after automatically updating to version 10.8.9.1
(released Nov 2020). This update might create an error with the Sophos Dynamic-link library (DLL).

### Root cause

Server 2008 RTM: On October 22, 2020, Segment Support deployed a minor update to the Sophos
Windows Endpoint client software, upgrading from version 10.8.4.4 VE3.77.1 to 10.8.9.1 VE3.79.0.
After this update, the Sophos Anti-Virus service no longer functions on Windows Server 2008 or
older operating systems.

Server 2008 R2: After February 1, 2021, the system blocks all data, product updates, and new 
installations on this operating system.

### Resolution

It's time to consider contacting your Customer Success Manager and technical team about how to
safely migrate your servers with a newer, supported version of Windows.
