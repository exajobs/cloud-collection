**Note: X-Cdn-Streaming-Uri and X-Cdn-Ios-Uri links will be discontinued on July 31, 2022**

**Disclaimer**: As of January 12, 2021, excluding the China variant  of Flash, 
the Flash executable has a built-in kill switch that prevents it from playing 
Flash files. As of February 2021, all major browsers block Flash and cannot 
play it. Only IE11, niche browser forks, and some browsers built for China plan
to continue support.

Streaming allows users to serve their content directly from Akamai&reg; edge
servers rather than downloading full files before they are viewable.
Using the OSMF plugins lets developers make their own Adobe Flash
players, giving them the flexibility to customize and brand them as they
want.

Download the [Advanced Streaming Plugin for OSMF](http://players.edgesuite.net/flash/landing/aasp/current/).

Because OSMF plugins enable you to develop your own Flash video player and
embed it as needed into your website, Rackspace does not have
step-by-step instructions. If you are looking for a player that does
not require development by your team, try our
[FlowPlayer plugins for Streaming over the Akamai CDN](/support/how-to/cloud-files-streaming-with-flowplayer-plugins).
