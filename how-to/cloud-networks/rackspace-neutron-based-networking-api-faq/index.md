Neutron is an OpenStack&reg; project that is the basis for all
networking services in the Rackspace Public Cloud. If you deploy
Rackspace Cloud Servers, you can use Rackspace Networking API based on
OpenStack Neutron to create and manage [Cloud Networks](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/networks/) and perform other
Networking operations.

{{<accordion title="Why are you introducing Rackspace Networking based on the OpenStack Neutron API?" col="in" href="accordion2">}}

At Rackspace, we have been using the /os-networksv2 Cloud Servers
extension to provision networking capabilities in the public cloud. This
extension uses nova-network API as a base and can
take advantage of Rackspace [Cloud Networks](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/networks/). After we introduced
the existing API, the Neutron OpenStack project has become the primary
Networking service in OpenStack. Moving forward, we plan to base the Rackspace Networking
API on the OpenStack Neutron API that is more granular than
the nova-network API and offers richer functionality and flexibility to
consume networking services.
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="What new capabilities does the new API have?" col="in" href="accordion3">}}

The API provides three primary top-level resources (networks, ports, and
subnets). Users can now:

-   Create and manage [Cloud Networks](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/networks/) by using the new API.
-   Assign routes to Cloud Servers at boot-time (Host routes).
-   Configure allocation pools for subnets (CIDRs) on Cloud Networks to
    control the dynamic IP address assignment on your Cloud Servers.
-   Provision an IP address of your choice on Isolated Networks ports.
-   Dual stack your Isolated Networks so that you have IPv4 and IPv6
    addresses on the same port.
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="Can I still use the old Networking API based on nova-network?" col="in" href="accordion4">}}

The existing Networking API (/osnetworksv2 servers extension)
still functions. However, we encourage you to move to the new Networking
API to take advantage of some of the new capabilities.
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="Can I attach and detach networks from servers using the new API?" col="in" href="accordion5">}}

Currently, you still have to use the Cloud Networks virtual interfaces
extension to attach and detach networks from a Cloud Server.
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="Can I perform the API functions using the Neutron client?" col="in" href="accordion7">}}

Neutron client is not currently supported. We plan to make the
client available in the future.
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="Where is my XML?" col="in" href="accordion8">}}

The Networking API returns JSON exclusively, there is no option to
receive responses in XML.
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="How do I create Networks with the new API?" col="in" href="accordion9">}}

You need to create a network and add a subnet to that network. This is
different from the older way of creating networks, which was a one-step
process. See the
[Cloud Networks Getting Started Guide](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-networks/v2/developer-guide/#document-getting-started)
for examples.
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="How many subnets can I provision on a network" col="in" href="accordion10">}}

We have a limit of one IPV4 subnet and one IPv6 subnet per network.
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="Can I create, update, or delete subnets on Public and ServiceNet?" col="in" href="accordion11">}}

No, These networks are Rackspace Provider networks and you cannot
modify them. You cannot control subnetting and IP addressing on these
networks.
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="Can I modify allocation pools on the subnet?" col="in" href="accordion12">}}

You can specify allocation pools for the subnet when you create a subnet,
but you cannot modify it.
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="When I change attributes on subnets, do they take effect on ports that are using it?" col="in" href="accordion13">}}

No, the changes to the attributes only take effect on any new ports
and servers that you create.
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="Can I create ports on Public and ServiceNet?" col="in" href="accordion14">}}

No, you can create ports only on Isolated Networks (cloud networks).
{{</accordion>}}
{{<accordion title="Can I have both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address on the same Isolated Network port?" col="in" href="accordion15">}}

Yes, you can provision both an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address on the
same port by using the **fixed_ips** attribute.
