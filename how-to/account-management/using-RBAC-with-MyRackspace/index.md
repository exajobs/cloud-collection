**Previous section:** [Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](/support/how-to/use-role-based-access-control-rbac)

The account owner implements Role Based Access Control (RBAC) by adding users to the account and assigning roles. This article is intended to guide account owners through this process by using the [Rackspace Dedicated](https://login.rackspace.com/).

For information about setting up RBAC through the API, see the [Rackspace Identity API Guide](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-identity/v2/developer-guide/).

**Note:** It is possible to assign a mix of multiple-product roles and per-product roles to one user through the API. The most permissive role determines the user's level of access.

### Account Credentials

Rackspace recommends that you change the account password before adding new users to the account.

When new users are created, a temporary password is assigned to them. They should change the temporary password at their first login.

Also, new users receive an email from Rackspace notifying them that they have been added to the account. They receive information on how to sign up for an account in the email.

### Create New Users

To create a new user, follow below steps:

**Step 1.** Log in to the [Rackspace Dedicated Account](https://login.rackspace.com/).

<img width="947" alt="Once updated the information then click Create User button" src="/support/how-to/using-rbac-with-myrackspace/myrack-account-RBAC5.png">

**Step 6.** To Manage permissions in the [Rackspace Dedicated Account](https://login.rackspace.com/) portal select **Account**>**Permissions**.

<img width="560" alt="Manage permissions select permissions under account" src="/support/how-to/using-rbac-with-myrackspace/myrack-account-RBAC6.png">

**Note**: To access the **Permissions** area in the MyRackspace Portal and modify another userâ€™s permissions, you must have either **Account Administrator** permission or **Admin permission**. Account Administrator permission grants the user unlimited access to all sections of the MyRackspace Portal. Admin permission (on a device or service) grants the user the ability to access and manage the device or service.

### Permission Types
There are two types of permissions available for Rackspace Dedicated Hosting accounts:
- **Direct permissions**: These grant the user direct access to account permissions, linked cloud accounts, devices, or services.

- **Effective permissions**: Users inherit effective permissions because of their memberships in user and product groups.

<img width="939" alt="Effective permissions are inherited" src="/support/how-to/using-rbac-with-myrackspace/myrack-account-RBAC8.png">

You can use the four tabs as shown in below image to assign permissions in the following ways:

### Global Permissions

The Global Permissions section lets you to make changes across your entire account.

Ticketing Settings enable you to control the tickets that your users have permission to see when those tickets include one or more devices.

The following table shows the ticketing settings that you need for common actions or views:

{{< table "table  table-striped table-bordered" >}}
| **Ticket Setting**  | **Functionality** |
|---------|--------|
| Flexible Ticket Viewing (default setting) | Enables users to see tickets that include a device that they have permission to view. For example, if a user has access to device A, they see all of the tickets that include device A, even if the ticket has other devices. If device C is later added to the ticket, the user can still see the ticket, even if the user does not have access to device C. |
| Strict Ticket Viewing | Requires users to have access to all the devices on a ticket to see that ticket. For example, if a ticket includes device A and device B, the user must have permissions to both devices to see the ticket. If a ticket the user could see later includes device C, to which the user has no access, the user can no longer see the ticket. |
